Making music is a huge part of my life! I am part of The Modern Wind Orchestra. Never heard of us? Don't worry, we are not that famous, BUT if you'd like to know more about us, wisit our website at [modernwind.de](https://modernwind.de/).

When im not currently making music or working i like to play DnD or other various TTRPGs with my friends. That's the inspiration for my very own loot-management system. You can try it out without any cost at [autolooter.de](https://autolooter.de/)
